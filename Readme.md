##Welcome to Polymer in Action
This GitHub project contains the full manuscript of my book edited for Manning "Polymer in Action" and the full source code grouped by Chapter.
I have decided to upload everything on GitHub because I believe that this book has a lot of potential and everybody should have the right to download it, read it and contribute to the project.

Of course the final manuscript is not available for the public but you can buy it online and make me happy!

###Structure of the Repository
The repository is structure in two major folders, "src" where all code is available and "book" where you can find the latest copy of the original manuscript.
You can just clone the entire repository, if you wish, and download it locally or simply start one of the applications available. There is almost 1 application for every chapter I wrote, sometimes even more.
